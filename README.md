## Description
With the recent tragedy at the National Museum in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the concern with fires in historic centers came to light, with this in mind, our team is developing a fire prevention system with the concepts learned in the Microprocessor Systems course, aiming for an efficient project so that it can be easily implemented in all the places that are deemed necessary. Thinking about the fires as well as in the economy and water preservation, *FEHMO* will do a quick analysis of the situation through temperature sensors and release 
the adequate amount of water to control and neutralize the fire, being ideal for the use with a fire hose, controlling her action.
